Roberto Prototype - Project URZA Notes
Instructions:
- Get a copy of the project From the branch, Download & Unzip
- Open it via Unity Hub (It will take some time to load the first time)
- Open the project, Remove the Default scene, and Add the Game test Scene from the Scenes Directory.

Stuff To check if Materials are not Loading:
- Go to package manager in Window and Install URP, TextMeshPro, and Shader Graph.

Stuff that needs to be added to the Project:
- The character does not shoot because the script has detached itself from the weapon game object (for some reason)
- Drag and Drop the weapon bullet Logic on to the game objects Weapon 1 and 2 and Adjust Some values.

Stuff to ignore:
- You'll Notice an error about Enemy Controller, Its a false flag for now as nothing is assigned to it.
